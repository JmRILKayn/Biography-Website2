          <h2>Biography of a BSIT student from Palawan State University</h2>
          &nbsp;
         <p>Jose Miguel F. Mayores, a.k.a "JM" is currently enrolled as a first-year
            Bachelor of Science in Information Technology (BSIT) student at Palawan State University (PSU).
             He was born in Roxas, Palawan on March 11, 2005. He loves to drive bicycles & motorcycles.
             He spend most of his free time watching movies, cooking and practicing different programming languages. </p>
             &nbsp;
         <p>Jose Miguel's parents were separated, and due to their separation, his mother found it difficult to provide for
             him during his school years. While the father of Jose Miguel abandoned him when he was very young, despite
             having these difficult challenges, he still manages to cope with them. Instead of being sad or depressed,
             Jose Miguel used this as inspiration to succeed in his academics and achieve his dream job.</p>
